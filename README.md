Housing Price Prediction using Machine Learning

Description
This project focuses on predicting housing prices based on geographical and demographic data. It explores the California housing dataset, encompassing longitude, latitude, housing age, room count, population, households, median income, and ocean proximity. The goal is to build accurate predictive models utilizing Adaboost, XGBoost, RandomForest, and a deep learning model.

Dataset Description
The dataset consists of housing-related features:

longitude: Longitude coordinate of the housing location.
latitude: Latitude coordinate of the housing location.
housing_median_age: Median age of housing in the area.
total_rooms: Total number of rooms in the housing area.
total_bedrooms: Total number of bedrooms in the housing area.
population: Total population in the housing area.
households: Total number of households in the housing area.
median_income: Median income of households in the area.
median_house_value: Median house value for households in the area.
ocean_proximity: Proximity to the ocean (categorical feature).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA phase uncovered significant insights:

Visualized geographical distributions.
Explored relationships between median house value and demographic features.
Investigated correlations and outliers.
